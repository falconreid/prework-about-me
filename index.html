      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a graphic and web designer running my own business since 2011.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Hawaii... we moved 6 months later. My dad was in the Navy, so we moved around a lot, from California, to South Carolina to Colorado, etc.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I play guitar, percussion, I'm a singer/songwriter, I read books, watch Netflix, I love kayaking, hiking and camping. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It was my dream to become a graphic designer. I still love doing it but I wanted to increase my skill set as a web designer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in beautiful Longmont Colorado.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As a designer I am concerned with how things look, but I also want to make sure what I do works exactly the way my clients want it to. I see plenty of well fucntioning sites that are visually stale, but also beautiful sites that don't work the way they should. I believe they should look and function great.</p>
